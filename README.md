# RAVEN (X) Clone

## Overview
This is a decentralized Twitter (X) clone built with React Vite for Frontend and ExpressJs and NodeJs for backend with Firebase for database implemented on the Celestia blockchain as part of a Mammothon project. The application is developed using the Chopin framework to ensure a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant, and scalable social media experience.

## Features
- **Decentralized Storage**: All tweets, likes, comments, and interactions are stored directly on the Celestia blockchain.
- **Chopin Framework Integration**: Utilizes Chopin for seamless blockchain interactions.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Fetch and display tweets dynamically.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and identity verification.
- **Tweet Management**: Post, edit, delete, and retrieve tweets.
- **Like & Retweet**: Engage with tweets through likes and retweets.
- **Commenting System**: Nested replies to tweets.
- **Decentralized Chat**: Secure direct messaging using on-chain encryption.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Backend**: ExpressJs and NodeJs
- **Storage**: Firebase
- **Blockchain**: Celestia
- **Authentication**: Chopin
- **API**: Chopin Framework
